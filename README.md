# Content Blockchain GUI Prototype

A proof of concept GUI Application for the [Content Blockchain](https://content-blockchain.org).

The **Content Blockchain Project** is building the foundational tools that enable journalists, publishers,
and media start-ups to create new innovative products, services and business models in the open blockchain economy.

We have started a [public testnet](https://explorer.content-blockchain.org/) and implemented 
this proof of concept application that allows users to:

- Run their own blockchain-node (testnet)
- Create an account on the blockchain
- Test the experimental voting based consensus mechanism
- Send and receive native blockchain coins
- Timestamp content on the blockchain

An installable version of he application is currently available for 64-Bit Windows.
You can download it [here](https://github.com/coblo/gui-demo/releases/download/v0.2.0/Coblo-0.2.0-win.msi).
